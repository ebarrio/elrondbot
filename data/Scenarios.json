This represents ships in the Elven fleet and piers inthe Grey Havens which are under attack by Corsairs and arebeing set on fire.\\nAt the end of each round, the players must place 1 damagetoken on each Aflame location in the staging area. Manyencounter card effects can also cause damage tokens to beplaced on Aflame locations.\\nIf at any point an Aflame location has damage tokens on itequal to its Aflame X value, it is destroyed, and must be placedfacedown underneath The Havens Burn objective card. Cardsfacedown underneath The Havens Burn are considered to beout of play.\\nIf an Aflame location is explored, it is placed in the discard pileas normal, and all damage tokens on it are also discarded.",
            "\\nWhen an enemy with the ambush keyword enters play, each player, starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, must make an engagement check. The engagement check is only made against the enemy that just entered play, and not other enemies that are in the staging area. If the enemy engages a player as the result of this effect, then no further engagement checks are made against it.",
            "\\n*Tom and Kris are playing the  scenario \"Into Ithilien,\" and two copies of  Southron Mercenaries are in play. Southron  Mercenaries has the keyword archery X, where  X is the number of players in the game. This  gives a cumulative archery value of 4. At the  beginning of the combat phase, the players  decide to deal 2 damage to Kris' ally Gandalf,  and 2 damage to Tom's hero Denethor.*\\nWhile a card with the archery keyword is in play, players must deal damage to character cards in play equal to the specified archery value at the beginning of each combat phase. This damage can be dealt to characters under any player's control, and it can be divided among the players as they see fit. If there is disagreement as to where to assign archery damage, the first player makes the final decision. If multiple cards with the archery keyword are in play, the effects are cumulative. Remember that :defenseblack: does not block archery damage.",
            "\\nAssault is a keyword that represents the army of Mordor's relentless attack on the city of Minas Tirith. While stage 3B is in play, progress cannot be placed on that stage by player card effects or by questing successfully. However, progress can still be placed on the active location as normal.\\nWhen the players quest unsuccessfully, each player does not raise his threat. Instead, the players must deal X damage to Minas Tirith. X is the amount by which the total threat in the staging area was greater than the total willpower of each character committed to the quest. (This damage is only calculated once for the group, not per player.)",
            "\\n*Tom has committed the  characters Gandalf and an Ithilien Tracker to  the quest card Ambush in Ithilien (1B), which  has the battle keyword. When resolving this  quest, instead of using his characters' :willpowerblack:, Tom  counts their total :attackblack:. Gandalf has an :attackblack:  of 4,  and the Ithilien Tracker has an :attackblack:  of 1, for a  total :attackblack:  of 5. Tom compares this total against  the :threatblack:  in the staging area, which is currently a  3. Tom therefore quests successfully, and makes  2 progress on the quest.*\\nIf a quest card has the battle keyword, when characters are committed to that quest, they count their total :attackblack: instead of their total :willpowerblack: when resolving the quest. Enemies and locations in the staging area still use their :threatblack: in opposition to this quest attempt.",
            "\\nBoarding is a keyword that appears on many ship-enemies. When a ship-enemy with the Boarding keyword engages a player from the staging area, reveal the top X cards from the Corsair Deck and put the revealed enemies into play, engaged with that player. Note that the Boarding keyword does not resolve if the ship-enemy engages a player from another player's play area, or from the encounter deck or discard pile.",
            "\\nThe Burn X keyword represents Smaug's devastating attack against Lake-town. When instructed to resolve Burn damage, total the amount of all Burn X on locations in play and assign it to the Lake-town objective. When assigning Burn damage, each player may exhaust any number of his characters to assign any number of Burn damage to those characters (up to their remaining hit points). Any damage not assigned to characters must be assigned to Lake-town.",
            "\\nCapture is a keyword that represents locations or enemies that guard one or more captured cards. When an encounter card or quest card with the capture X keyword enters play, before resolving that card's \"when revealed\" effects, each player takes the top X cards of his or her captured deck and captures them by placing them facedown underneath that card. (If the players are at different stages of the quest, only the players at that stage perform this act.) ",
            "\\nAfter the players travel to a Deep location, they discard it and replace it with the top card of the Caves deck. That location then becomes the active location. If there are no cards remaining in the Caves deck, the Deep keyword is ignored.",
            "\\nDefense is a keyword that represents the army of Saruman laying siege to Helm's Deep and their efforts to capture the fortress. While the current quest has the defense keyword, players cannot place progress on the quest (or active location) by questing successfully. Instead, the encounter deck tries to place progress on the current quest. If the encounter deck defeats stage 4B, the army of Saruman captures Helm's Deep, and the players lose the game.\\nDuring quest resolution, if the total :threatblack: in the staging area is greater than the total :willpowerblack: of characters committed to the quest, players do not raise their threat by the difference. Instead, the first player places progress on the current quest equal to the difference. \\nThe active location still acts as a buffer to the quest, so progress made by the encounter deck or encounter card effect must be placed on the active location first before it is placed on the quest (unless a card effect bypasses the active location). When a quest has progress equal to its quest points, that stage is defeated and the players should advance to the next stage as usual. ",
            "\\nThe dire keyword represents the world-changing endeavors that the heroes of Middle-Earth undertook in the final book of *The Lord of the Rings*. While the main quest has the dire keyword, each player's threat elimination level is increased to 99 and each player's threat cannot be reduced by more than 1 each round by non-boon player card effects. Boon card effects that reduce player's threat are not affected by the dire keyword. Additionally, the threat value for triggering **Valour** effects is changed from 40 threat to 80.",
            "\\nThe Discover keyword represents the heroes' search for lost treasure, as well as the unexpected dangers they encounter as they travel to the different locations in the scenario. When a location with the Discover keyword becomes the active location, the first player resolves the following steps in order:\\n --Look at the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the active locations Discover value.\u00a0\\n --Choose 1 looked at objective with the Loot keyword and attach it to the active location as a guarded objective.\\n --Randomly select 1 looked at card with the ***Hazard*** trait, reveal it and add it to the staging area.\\n --Place any remaining looked at cards in the encounter discard pile.\\nIf there are less than X cards remaining in the encounter deck when resolving the Discover keyword, shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and continue resolving the Discover keyword.",
            "\\nIf an encounter card with the doomed keyword is revealed during the staging step of the quest phase or in setup, each player must raise his threat level by the specified value.",
            "*David is playing Temple of the Deceived  and a Flooded Ruins is the active location. Adjacent  to the Flooded Ruins are two copies of Lost Island,  one above and one to the right. There are no  locations to the left or below the Flooded Ruins.  Both of the adjacent Lost Islands are considered  to be in the staging area, and therefore contribute  their combined :threatblack:  of 4 to the staging area. After  questing successfully, David places progress on the  Flooded Ruins equal to its quest points (5), and the  remainder is placed on the current quest. Normally,  this would explore the Flooded Ruins, but because  of the Exploration keyword, it remains in play. Then,  during the Travel phase, because the Flooded Ruins  has progress on it equal to its quest points, David  may travel to a location in the staging area. He  travels to the Lost Island to the right of the Flooded  Ruins, moving his active location marker from the  Flooded Ruins to the Lost Island and removing  all progress from the Flooded Ruins, but keeping  it in play without flipping it (it is now considered  \"explored\"**). He then flips the Lost Island card  faceup, due to the ** Forced**  effect on the Lost Island.*\\nThe Exploration keyword on the main quest represents the player's ability to traverse the Island Map prepared during the setup of the scenario. In this scenario, locations are not revealed from the encounter deck, and the entire island is laid out for the players to explore, one location at a time.\\nLocations in the Island Map cannot leave the Island Map for any reason, nor can they leave their individual positions within the island (for example, an effect that would switch two locations does not work in this scenario). The Island Map is not the same as the staging area and does not function in the same way. Note that there is still a staging area, which is used for enemies and other cards that would be placed into the staging area.\\nDuring this scenario, the active location is represented through the use of an \"active location marker,\" which can be a resource token or a pawn\/figurine of the players' choice. **The active location is not moved out of its place in the island map when the players travel to it. The locations adjacent (orthogonally, not diagonally) to the active location are considered to be in the staging area.** All of the other locations on the Island Map are not considered to be in the staging area.\\nWhen the players quest successfully, progress is still placed on the active location before it is placed on the current quest, up to that location's quest points, as normal. However, if progress is placed on any location equal to its quest points, it is not immediately explored. Instead, it remains in play. \\nDuring the Travel phase, if the active location has progress on it equal to its quest points, the players have the option to travel to a location in the staging area (i.e. an adjacent location). If the active location does not have enough progress on it, they cannot travel from it. **If the players travel to another location, all progress is removed from the active location, and their active location marker is moved to the new location**. At this point, the formerly active location is considered \"explored,\" although **it is not discarded or flipped over**, and remains in place. Because players always travel from one location directly to another in this scenario, there is always an active location at any given moment in time. Remember that flipping an Uncharted location also removes all progress from it.\\nPlayers can freely travel around the Island Map using the above rules, and may return to locations they have already explored. Your goal is to find the entrance to the underwater Grotto which is somewhere inside the grand temple\" the three locations on the rightmost side of the Island Map. But, in order to enter the Temple, you must find the Gate Key somewhere on the island.",
            "Frostbite is a new keyword in The Gap of Rohan. The Frostbite keyword represents the effects of the worsening storm, as the heroes struggle to press onward despite lacking the proper provisions.

Tom has the option of committing more than  1 character, but he does not wish to do so. After  committing \u00c9owyn, Tom deals 2 cards from the  top of the encounter deck. These cards are the  Giant Marsh Worm (which has an escape score  of 2, and Through the Mist, which has an escape  score of 3). Since the committed :willpowerblack:  of 4 is lower  than the total escape score of 5, Tom has failed  this escape test. He follows the instructions on  the Nightfall card, and places 1 resource token  on Gollum and each player's threat raises by 2.  Finally, the cards dealt for the escape test are  placed in the encounter discard pile.*\\nTo make an escape test, a player first commits characters to the test. A character must exhaust to commit to an escape test. Each committed character counts its :willpowerblack: strength for the test. After committing characters to the test, the players may take actions or play event cards. If a single player is required to make an escape test, only that player may commit characters he controls to the test. If the party is required to make an escape test, all players have the option of committing characters they control to the test. Once the characters are committed, a number of cards (as instructed by the card text dictating the escape test) are dealt from the encounter deck. Many of the cards in this encounter deck have a bold Escape value. Any card that does not have a printed escape value is considered to have a base escape value of zero. When dealing cards for an escape test, ignore all other effects on the dealt cards. Once these cards are dealt, the total committed :willpowerblack: is compared to the total dealt escape value to determine if the escape test is passed or failed. If the total committed :willpowerblack: is higher than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is passed, and nothing happens. If the total committed :willpowerblack: is equal to or lower than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is failed, and the players follow the instructions for failing the escape test from the card that required the test be made. After an escape test, all cards dealt for that test are placed in the encounter discard pile.__Reset the Quest Deck__\\nWhile playing this scenario, players might be instructed to \"reset the quest deck to stage 1B.\" To do this, the players take the previously defeated stage 1 quest card, and return it to the quest deck as if they are just beginning that stage.

Any progress tokens that were on the current quest are removed before the quest deck resets. Progress tokens that were on the active location, however, remain on that location.

These shuffled stage 2 quest cards are considered to be the \"quest deck\". Players will progress through stage 2 quest cards until they have won the game; there is no stage 3.

The only exception to this are card effects that reveal and flip a new quest card, such as on Hasty Council.__Bypassing a Quest Card__\\nPlayers are given the option to bypass some of the quest cards at the end of the combat phase. Bypassing the current quest removes all progress tokens on it, and moves it to the bottom of the quest deck with side 2B face down. Bypassing a quest is optional, and players may choose to stay on each quest card instead of bypassing it.When a quest is completed, players will either add it to their victory display or win the game.__The Nameless Fear__\\nThe Nameless Fear is an enemy that cannot engage or be engaged by players. The Nameless Fear is also immune to card effects, which means that it cannot be selected as the target of any card effect, and ignores the effect of any card that would directly interact with it.

If this test is failed, raise each  player's threat by 7, remove all progress tokens  from play, and trigger all \"**Lost**:\" effects in  play.\"*\\n*When this card is revealed, Eric, the first player,  must make a locate test. He can choose to fail  the test immediately by not discarding any cards  from his hand, but decides to try and beat it.  He discards 1 card from his hand and discards  the top card of the encounter deck. It did not  have a bold \" **PASS** \" printed in its text box, and  so he did not pass the locate test. He decides  to try again, discarding another card from his  hand. This time the discarded encounter card  does have \" **PASS** \"printed in its text box, and  so Eric has passed the test. He ignores the \"If\" statement on \"Vast and Intricate\" and the card  is discarded with no further effect.*\\nWhile playing this scenario, players are at times instructed to make a \"Locate Test\". These tests represent the heroes' attempts to maintain a sense of direction in the mines. A locate test is made by a single player, as specified by the card initiating the test. The player making the locate test may choose and discard 1 card from his hand to discard the top card of the encounter deck. Many of the cards in The Long Dark encounter deck have a bold \"PASS\" printed in the bottom right hand corner of their text box. If the discarded encounter card has \"PASS\" printed in its text box, then the test succeeds, and no ill effects trigger. If the card does not have \"PASS\" printed in its text box, then the player has not succeeded, but may attempt the test again, repeating this action until either the test is successful or he no longer wishes (or is able to) discard more cards. If a player runs out of cards or declares that he is not willing to discard any more cards to the test, then the test is considered a failure, and players should follow the rest of the instructions on the card that initiated the test.__Cave Torch__\\nThis scenario uses the Cave Torch objective card. During setup the first player selects any hero to attach it to, and that hero bears the Cave Torch for the rest of the game. If Cave Torch would leave play, then it is removed from the game. Do not place any \"removed from game\" cards in the discard pile, as effects that bring cards back from the discard pile no longer interact with these cards. __Next Player__\\nThe next player is the player sitting directly to the left of the player referenced by the card effect. If there are no other players in the game, there is no next player.\\n__\"Lost:\" Effects\\n__\\nSome cards have \"**Lost**:\" effects on them. These effects are only triggered by other card effects, and are not tied to any timing structure or phase of the game.__Immune to Ranged Damage__\\nGreat Cave-troll has the text, \"Immune to ranged damage.\" \"Immune to ranged damage\" means that characters participating in an attack via the ranged keyword are not able to deal damage to that enemy. (If a ranged character participates in an attack against Great Cave-troll through another means than the ranged keyword, then it is able to damage it and will count its :attackblack:.)",

This encounter set will be shuffled into the encounter deck at a later point in the scenario.__Creating a Staging Area__\\nWhen instructed to \"Create your own staging area,\" each player sets aside an area in front of himself to serve as his own private staging area. Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the First Player (which continues to move), but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently present in the game.\\n --Players cannot affect players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player's threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\\n --During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 4 players have been separated, each player would add 1 card to his staging area.\\n --Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area. For example, if an effect references \"each player,\" then that effect only refers to each player that shares the staging area to which the encounter card would be added.__Joining Another Player__\\nOn stage 4B players are instructed to \"join another player\" after completing their current quest card. Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase. The joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in his own staging area to the staging area of the player(s) he is joining with, keeping any enemies engaged with him and discarding any active location in the staging area being left. If multiple players complete their current quest card during the same phase, they join quests starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise around the table. If there is no player to join, then players must continue to stage 5. \\n__Encounter Cards with Actions__\\nAn \"**Action**:\" on an encounter card in play can be triggered by any player, following normal restrictions on triggering abilities.",

A captured deck represents the allies, heroes and equipment taken from each player's party that he or she must find and recover before they can be played.\\nTo prepare a captured deck, remove all allies, ***Item*** attachments,***Mount*** attachments, and ***Artifact *** attachments from the player deck, and shuffle them together. This pile is now referred to as your captured deck. A captured deck does not have its own discard pile; any cards that are discarded from a captured deck are placed in its owner's discard pile.\\nAfter preparing his or her captured deck, each player chooses only 1 hero to be his or her starting hero. Then, each player randomly sets aside 1 of his or her other heroes, facedown. Shuffle any remaining heroes into their owner's captured decks, then place each facedown set aside hero on top of its owner's captured deck.__Captured Cards and Rescuing Cards__\\nWhen cards are captured facedown underneath an encounter card, those cards are called \" captured cards,\" and are considered to be out of play, under no player's control. This can occur from the capture X keyword, or from encounter card effects that instruct a player to capture 1 or more cards underneath a specified card. If a card is captured from play, all tokens on that card and attachments on that card are discarded.\\nWhen an encounter card or quest card with 1 or more captured cards underneath it leaves play, all of the captured cards underneath it are \"rescued\" by their owners. Rescued cards are placed in their owners' hands. If a hero card is rescued, immediately put it into play under its owner's control.__Creating a Staging Area__\\nWhen each player is instructed to \"create his own staging area,\" each player sets aside an area in front of himself to serve as his own private staging area. Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the First Player (which continues to move), but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently in the game.\\n --Players cannot affect players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player's threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\\n --During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 4 players have been separated, each player would add 1 card to his staging area.\\n --Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area. For example, if an effect references \"each player,\" then that effect only refers to each player that shares the staging area to which the encounter card would be added.__Joining Another Player__\\nOn stage 2B players are instructed to \"join another player\" if there are no captured cards underneath it. Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase. The joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in his own staging area to the staging area of the player(s) he is joining with, keeping any enemies engaged with him and discarding any active location in the staging area being left. If multiple players have no captured cards underneath stage 2B during the same phase, they join quests starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise around the table. If there is no player to join, then players must continue to stage 3.",

(The quest stages labeled stage 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A are used in the player's quest deck, as normal.) Then, in an area next to the Stormcaller's quest deck, place the Stormcaller enemy card.__The Stormcaller's Area__\\nThe Stormcaller's area is a play area, separate from the staging area, that represents the *Stormcaller*'s journey in its attempt to flee from the players. As the players advance through their quest deck, the Stormcaller also advances through its quest deck, attempting to reach and defeat stage 4 before the players do. The quest stage on top of the Stormcaller's quest deck is called \"the Stormcaller's current quest stage.\" Each of these quest stages has the following text: \"**Forced**: At the end of the round, discard the top card of the encounter deck. The Stormcaller places progress on this stage equal to its :threatblack: plus the :threatblack: of the discarded card.\" Every round, this effect causes the Stormcaller to make progress on its stage, just as the players try to make progress on their quest stage. If the Stormcaller's current quest stage has progress on it equal to or above its quest points, it advances to the next quest stage in the same way players would, first advancing to the \"C\" side of the next stage, resolving its effects, and then advancing to the \"D\" side.\\nWhile the Stormcaller is at a different quest stage than the players, cards in the Stormcaller's area are immune to player card effects, cannot leave the Stormcaller's area, and are not considered to be in the staging area (and thus do not contribute their :threatblack: to the total :threatblack: in the staging area). Players are considered to be at \"the same stage\"as the Stormcaller if their main quest stage's name and number match the Stormcaller's current quest stage (\"2B\" Full Sail Ahead!\" and \"2D\" Full Sail Ahead!\", for example).**When the players and the Stormcaller are at the same quest stage, cards in the Stormcaller's area are no longer immune to player card effects, can leave the Stormcaller's area, and are considered to be in the staging area** (and thus **do** contribute their :threatblack: to\u00a0 the total :threatblack: in the staging area). Thus, by catching up to the same quest stage as the Stormcaller, the players can travel to locations in the Stormcaller's area and engage ships in the Stormcaller's area, including the Stormcaller itself.",

First, the players must remove the double-sided \"Shrine to Morgoth\" card and set it aside (this card is put into play during stage 2). Then, turn the remained of the double-sided locations ***Grotto*** side face-up, and shuffle then together into a separate pile. This pile is referred to as \"the Grotto deck.\"\\nPlayers may freely look at the ***Grotto*** side of the top location of the Grotto deck. However, players cannot look at the facedown ***Underwater*** sides of any location until they are instructed to flip that location. **Flipping a double-sided location from one side to the another removes all progress from it**. \\nDuring the game, locations will often be placed from the top of the Grotto deck into the staging area. This must be done with the location entering with its ***Grotto*** side face-up, without looking at its ***Underwater*** side (unless instructed otherwse).\\nBecause these locations are double-sided, they cannot enter the encounter deck or discard pile for any reason. When one of these locations is explored, if its ***Grotto*** side is face-up, it is shuffled back into the Grotto deck, ***Grotto*** side face-up. If it is ***Underwater*** side face-up when it is explored, it has the victory keyword and is therefore placed in the victory display.\\nNote that Grotto locations do not always have the same Underwater location on its facedown side.\\n",

To prepare the Orcs' area, the players must prepare a second quest deck consisting of stage 1C, stage 2C, stage 3D, and stage 4C, in that order. (The quest stages labeled stage 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A are used in the player's quest deck, as normal.)__The Orcs' Area__\\nThe Orcs' area is a new play area, separate from the staging area, that represents the Orcs' pursuit as they try to overtake the players on their journey through Harad. As the players advance through their quest deck, the Orcs also advance through their quest deck, attempting to reach the same stage as the players and defeat it before they do. The quest stage on top of the Orcs' quest deck is called \"the Orcs' stage.\" Each of these quest stages has the following text: \"**Forced**: At the end of the quest phase, discard the top card of the encounter deck. Place X progress on this stage, where X is the discarded card's :threatblack: plus the total :threatblack: in the Orcs' area.\" Every round, this effect causes the Orcs to make progress on their stage, just as the players try to make progress on their quest stage. If the Orcs' quest stage has progress on it equal to or above its quest points, they advance to the next quest stage in the same way players would, first advancing to the \"C\" side of the next stage, resolving its effects, and then advancing to the \"D\" side.\\nWhile the Orcs are at a different quest stage than the players, cards in the Orcs' are immune to player card effects, cannot leave the Orcs' area, and are not considered to be in the staging area (and thus do not contribute their :threatblack: to the total :threatblack: in the staging area). Players are considered to be \"at the same stage\" as the Orcs if their main quest stage's name and number match the Orcs' quest stage (\"2B Racing North\" and \"2D Racing North\", for example).\\n**When the players and the Orcs are at the same quest stage, cards in the Orcs' area are no longer immune to player card effects, can leave the Orcs' area, and are considered to be in the staging area** (and thus **do **contribute their :threatblack: to the total :threatblack: in the staging area).

These shuffled stage 2 quest cards are considered to be the \"quest deck\".\\nPlayers will progress through stage 2 quest cards until they have won the game; there is no stage 3. Quest cards are not flipped to side B immediately when revealed. Rather, the current quest card is revealed only at the beginning of the quest phase. Flipping the quest card this way causes\u00a0 the B side to be revealed.__Bypassing a Quest Card__\\nPlayers are given the option to bypass some of the quest cards at the end of the combat phase. Bypassing the current quest removes all progress tokens on it, and moves it to the bottom of the quest deck with side 2B face down. Bypassing a quest is optional, and players may choose to stay on each quest card instead of bypassing it. When a quest stage is bypassed (or defeated), it causes the next stage 2A to be revealed, triggering its 'when revealed' effect.\\n**When a quest is completed, players will either add it to their victory display or win the game.**__The Caves Deck__\\nTo create the Caves deck, take each card from the\u00a0*Lost Caves\u00a0*encounter set and shuffle them together.

If you have no cards in your deck at the end of the round, your characters starve to death and you?re eliminated from the game.\\nIn order to avoid that horrible fate, players will need to more judicious than normal when it comes to triggering various card drawing abilities.

Caves are immune to player card effects. Throughout the game, players move unique tokens representing themselves and Helm Hammerhand around a 4-by-3 grid of cave cards, called the Caves Map. When a player?s token is on a cave, that player and each character that player controls are considered to be at that cave. Travel actions on caves can only be performed by a player at that cave. Other game mechanics, like ranged and sentinel, function as normal, even while players are at different caves.\\n**Adjacent vs. Connected Caves**\\nTwo caves are called **adjacent **if they occupy neighboring positions in the Caves Map. Diagonal caves are **not adjacent**. Two **adjacent **caves are also called **connected **if the artwork on their shared border shows a continuous path.\\n__Setting Up the Caves Map__\\n\\n --Shuffle the caves together and deal them faceup in a 4-across, 3-down grid in their own play area.\\n --Starting with the first player, each player takes turns swapping any 2 **adjacent **caves in the Caves Map. The players may make up to 6 swaps in this way. After the swaps, if any cave cannot be reached from the top-left cave by a continuous path of **connected\u00a0**caves, raise each player's threat by 1 and return to step 1. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.\\n --Each player places a unique player token on the top-left cave (this does not count as moving to that cave). These tokens can be anything as long as they are different from the standard game tokens. Place another unique token on the bottom-right cave. This is Helm Hammerhand's token and marks his current cave.\\n__Clues__\\nClues are facedown cards attached to caves. To set up the clues:\\n\\n --Shuffle the 12 cards of the *Search for the Horn\u00a0*encounter set together to form the Clue Deck. Look at the top 2[perplayer] cards, and place a resource token on each cave indicated by name in the bottom right corner of those cards. If all of the indicated caves are in the left half of the Caves Map, remove all resource tokens from the Caves Map and repeat this step.\\n --Remove the bottom card of the Clue Deck from the game without looking at it. The cave indicated on this card represents the secret whereabouts of Helm's Horn.\\n --Shuffle the 11 remaining cards of the Clue Deck together again and attach 1 card from it facedown to each cave with a resource token. Then, remove all resource tokens from the Caves Map.\\n --Look at the remainder of the Clue Deck and place a damage token on each indicated cave. These have been ruled out as possible places for Helm's Horn. Shuffle the looked at cards into the encounter deck.\\n\\nTo move a player or Helm Hammerhand to another cave, move the corresponding unique token to that cave. Typically, when players move, they must move to a **connected**\u00a0cave. Helm Hammerhand, being a wraith, typically moves to an **adjacent**\u00a0cave, regardless of whether that cave happens to be **connected**. If Helm Hammerhand is instructed to move toward the nearest player, and there exist multiple equidistant paths toward a nearest player, the first player decides which of those paths Helm Hammerhand will take.__\"Search This Cave\"__\\nThe text \"search this cave\" is found in a travel action on each cave in the Caves Map. It represents the players searching that cave for a clue to the whereabouts of Helm's Horn, so that they can find the horn and sound it in Helm's presence to quell the vengeful spirit.\u00a0\\nTo \"search this cave\", reveal the clue card attached to that cave as if it were revealed by the encounter deck. After resolving the staging of the clue card, add a damage token to the cave indicated in the clue card's bottom right corner. You cannot search a cave if it has no attached clue.\\nAfter all the clues have been revealed, only 1 undamaged cave will remain, corresponding to the card that was removed from the game during the Caves Map setup.__Hard Mode__\\n*The Glittering Caves* has an additional difficulty mode called hard mode. To play in hard mode, during step 1 of setting up the clues, look at the top 10 cards of the Clues Deck instead of only the top 2[perplayer] cards.__A Long-extended Party__\\nAn unofficial fan scenario, developed by A Long-extended Party (ALeP).

Both quest cards are in play simultaneously as explained below. __The Riddle Area__\\nStage 1A instructs players to create a riddle area. The riddle area is a play area, separate from the staging area, that represents Bilbo's riddling contest against Gollum. The riddle area consists of stage 2 of the quest deck, Riddles in the Dark, as well as the Gollum enemy card and the Bilbo's Magic Ring objective card. Bilbo Baggins is also placed in the riddle area when setting up this scenario.\\nCards in the riddle area (including Bilbo Baggins) are immune to player card effects and cannot leave the riddle area except through specific quest card effects. While Gollum is in the riddle area, he does not contribute his threat during the quest phase and cannot be engaged by the players. While Bilbo Baggins is in the riddle area, the first player still controls him; however, he cannot quest, attack, take damage from cards other than Gollum, have attachments played on him by the players, or defend (except against Gollum).__Riddles__\\n*Tom has committed his heroes to the  quest Out of the Frying Pan. The first encounter  card he reveals is Wild Wargs which has a riddle  effect. Tom is the first player so he has to choose  between adding Wild Wargs to the staging area or  answering the riddle on the card. He chooses to  answer the riddle which reads: \"**Riddle**: The first  player names a card type, shuffles his deck, and  discards the top 2 cards. For each of those cards  that matches, place 1 progress on stage 2.\"*\\n*Tom names the ally card type, shuffles his deck,  and discards 2 cards from the top of his deck.  He discards the cards: Sneak Attack (event) and  Cram (attachment). Since he did not discard  an ally card, he does not have any matches.  This would trigger Gollum's game text which  reads:\"**Forced**: After the first player answers a  riddle and fails to find at least 1 match, Gollum  attacks Bilbo Baggins.\"However, Tom decides to use the text on Bilbo's  Magic Ring, which reads: \"**Action**: When attempting  to answer a riddle, spend 1 :baggins:  resource to discard an  additional card.\"*\\n*Bilbo Baggins has 2 resources in his resource pool,  so Tom spends 1 to discard an additional card  from his deck, which is A Test of Will (event). Tom  still has not met the requirements of the riddle, so  he spends the last resource from Bilbo Baggins'  resource pool to discard yet another card from his  deck, which is Erebor Hammersmith (ally). Now  Tom has 1 match, so he places 1 progress token on  Riddles in the Dark. After answering the riddle, Tom  places the Wild Wargs card in the encounter discard  pile. Since Tom did find a match, Gollum does not  attack Bilbo Baggins at this time.*\\n\"Riddle\" is a new game effect featured on some encounter cards. When an encounter card with a riddle effect is revealed from the encounter deck, the first player must choose between resolving that card normally or answering the riddle on that card. The first player can only choose to answer a riddle if it is revealed from the encounter deck. If a card with riddle is dealt as a shadow card, the first player cannot choose to answer it at that time.\\nTo answer a riddle,the first player must follow the directions printed on the riddle, in the following steps:\\n*Step 1*- Each riddle effect begins with the text, \"The first player names a ___.\" The first player makes a guess based on the item(s) he is instructed (by the riddle) to name: card type, sphere, or cost. Card types that can be named are ally, event, attachment, or treasure. The spheres that can be named are leadership, spirit, lore, tactics, and Baggins. Cost can be any number.\\n*Step 2*- The second part of a riddle is presented by the text, \"shuffles his deck and discards the top X cards of his deck.\" The first player shuffles his deck and then discards X cards from the top of his deck, as determined by the riddle. \\n*Step 3*- The final part of a riddle effect is presented by the text, \"For each of those cards that matches, place 1 progress on stage 2.\" The first player places 1 progress on stage 2 for each card discarded by the riddle effect that matches the named card type \/ sphere \/ cost from step 1. When instructed to name multiple items, a \"match\" is defined by a card that features each of the named items.",

Each stage of the Flies and Spiders scenario includes the following game text: \"Unconscious characters cannot quest, attack, defend, collect resources, trigger abilities, be poisoned, or ready (except by effects that target unconscious characters).\" These characters have been incapacitated by the spiders.\\nIf any number of poison is removed from a character, or that character leaves play, then those poison cards are placed in their owner's discard pile.__Ready an Unconscious Character__\\nWhen a card effect instructs a player to \"ready an unconscious character,\" that player chooses an unconscious character and rotates that character 180 degrees so that it appears in its ready position. That character is now ready and is no longer considered to be unconscious.__Creating a Staging Area__\\nOn stage 2B the players are instructed to \"Reveal stage 3 and create a separate staging area for the first player using that stage.\" To do this the first player sets aside an area in front of himself to serve as his own private staging area. The rest of the players continue to share the original staging area. Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the first player, but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently present in the game.\\n --Players cannot affect other players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player's threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\\n --During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 3 players share the original staging area, the first player would reveal 1 encounter card and the other players as a group would reveal 3.\\n --Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area. For example, if an effect references \"each player,\" then that effect only refers to each player that shares the staging area to which the encounter card would be added.__Combining Staging Areas__\\nStage 3B reads: \"When this stage is complete, do not advance to stage 4 until the end of the quest phase. (Combine staging areas if necessary.)\" When the first player places the final progress on this stage he must wait until the end of the quest phase to advance in order to allow the other players to resolve their quest phase. Then, the first player joins the other players at stage 4. Any enemy or location cards in the first player's staging area are added to the original staging area. Any enemies engaged with the first player remain engaged with that player when the staging areas are combined.",

When a player is instructed to make a Fortitude test, he may exhaust any number of heroes he controls to commit them to the test. Then, he must discard the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the tens digit of his threat dial. If the total willpower of the heroes committed to the test is greater than the number of Sauron's Eye icons on the encounter cards discarded for the test, that player successfully passes the Fortitude test. If the number of Sauron's Eye icons is equal to or greater than the total willpower of the committed heroes, that player fails the Fortitude test.

Then he discards cards from the top of the encounter deck equal to the tens digit of his threat, which is 43. The first card has no Sauron's Eye icon, but the second has 1, and the third and fourth each have 2, which makes the total number of 5 Sauron's Eye icons. With the total willpower committed to the test being equal to the number of Sauron's Eye icon, it looks like Jason will fail the test, but than he exhausts Rosie Cotton to add her 2 willpower to Sam Gamgee's, which raises his total willpower to 7. As a result, jason passes the test.\\nFortitude tests interrupt the regular turn sequence and create a new action window. After the total number of Sauron's Eye icons on the discarded encounter cards has been determined, players are allowed to take actions. Once the Fortitude test is resolved, play continues as normal and player actions are restricted to regular action windows.__Epic Multiplayer Mode__\\n*The Black Gate Opens* and *Mount Doom*, can be played simultaneously by 2-8 players in epic multiplayer mode. Epic multiplayer mode divides a group of players into 2 teams: one team plays *The Black Gate Opens* and on team plays *Mount Doom*. Each scenario is its own game with its own staging area and requires its own encounter deck to play, but the teams at each scenario must work together in order to defeat Sauron and win each game.\\nTo play in epic multiplayer mode, follow the Setup instructions on the double-sided setup card labeled \"Epic Multiplayer Mode\".__Setting Up Epic Multiplayer Mode__\\nThe Setup instructions on the Epic Multiplayer Mode card directs the players to create 2 separate staging areas: one for *The Black Gate Opens* and one for *Mount Doom*. To do this, choose a play area large enough for both scenarios and follow the **Setup **instructions on each scenario as normal.\u00a0\\nNext, the players divide themselves into 2 teams, one team for each scenario.
